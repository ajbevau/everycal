<h1>Every Calendar +1 Custom Expressions</h1>
<p>Custom expressions allow you to write complex repeating patterns. These are loosely modelled on crontab syntax so if you're familiar with it then this should not be too different. <strong>Please note that ALL expression components must match for a date to be considered.</strong> Here are some examples, the syntax is explained below:</p>
<pre>
Simple examples:
 DoM  MoY  DoW  WsE
  *    *    1    *    Every Sunday
  1   */2   *    *    First day every 2nd month
  1   3/2   *    *    First day every 2nd month when month is March
 -1    *    *    *    Last day of the month
  *    *    6   1,-1  First after epoch and last Friday before 1 year repeat
  *    *    1   1/3   Every 3rd Sunday (1st in group)
  *    *    4   2/4   Every 4th Wednesday (2nd in group)
  *    *   1/3   *    The 3rd Sunday of every month
  *    *   2/-1  *    Last Monday every month
  *   */3  1/-2  *    2nd last Sunday every 3rd month
 -2   */6  4,5/5 *    2nd last day of every 6 month where it is the 5th Wed|Thur of the month

Some more complicated expression examples:
 DoM    MoY            DoW      WoY
 *      *              2/1,-1   *         First and last Monday of every month
 10-20  *              2        *         Mondays between 10th and 20th
 *      2,3,4,5,12     2/-1     *         Last Monday of Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Dec
 5-25   3,4,5,9,10,11  6/1,4    *         1st|4th Friday of the month where day is 5th-25th in Autumn/Spring
 *      */3            1/-1--3  *         Last, 2nd and 3rd Last Sundays of every 3rd month
 2-8    2,5,9,10/2,5   3,4/1,2  *         1st/2nd Tue|Wed where is 2nd-8th in Feb|May|Sep|Oct and is 2nd or 5th Month cycle since start
 *      1,2,12         2,3      1,2/5,7   Mon|Tue of 1st|2nd weeks in a 5|7 week rolling cycle since epoch in Summer month
</pre>
<ul>
	<li>DoM - Day of the Month: 1 means 1st of month</li>
	<li>MoY - Month of the Year: 1 means January</li>
	<li>DoW - Day of the Week: 1 means Sunday</li>
	<li>WsE - Weeks since Epoch (the event start date)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Day of Month</h2>
<p>The DoM values can take one of 5 forms and represent the numbered day of the month:</p>
<ol>
	<li>* - Any day can be a repeat</li>
	<li>A positive number - Only the Xth day can be a repeat</li>
	<li>A negative number - Only the last Xth day can be a repeat</li>
	<li>Comma separated - Only the listed days (postive and negative) can be a repeat</li>
	<li>X-Y - All days from X to Y (inclusive) can be a repeat</li>
</ol>

<h2>Month of Year</h2>
<p>The MoY values have two sub-parts which both have various forms which combine to represent a calendar month (Jan-Dec):</p>
<ol>
	<li>The first part is the month numeric index match where 1 = January and 12 = December (REQUIRED):
	<ol>
		<li>* - Any month can have repeats</li>
		<li>Positive number - Only the specific month can have repeats</li>
		<li>Comma separated - Only the specified months can have repeats</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li>The second part is optional and if given should be separated from the first part by a /. The second part represents the cycle period(s) for rolling months (e.g. every 3rd month):
	<ol>
		<li>Positive number - Every Xth month (e.g. */2 is every 2nd month)</li>
		<li>Comma separated - Every Xth, Yth, Zth, etc.. month (e.g. */2,3 is every 2nd and every 3rd month)</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>The cycle periods start from the event epoch (i.e. the scheduled start date of the event); if multiple cycles are specified they repeat independently of each other.</p>

<h2>Day of Week</h2>
<p>The DoW values represent the specific days of a week (i.e. 1 = Sunday and 7 = Saturday) which an event can run on. Once again divided into two sub-parts:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The first part is the day numeric index (REQUIRED):
	<ol>
		<li>* - Any day of the week</li>
		<li>Positive number - Only the specific day of the week</li>
		<li>Comma separated - Only the specified days of the week</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li>The second part is optional and if given should be separated from the first part by a /. The second part represents the Xth time this day has occured in a month:
	<ol>
		<li>Positive number - Only the Xth occurance of the specified days (e.g. 1/1 is first Sunday, 6/4 is fourth Friday)</li>
		<li>Negative number - Only the last Xth occurance of the specified days (e.g. 1/-1 is last Sunday)</li>
		<li>Comma separated - All of the Xth, Yth, Zth, etc... occurances (e.g. 1/1,-1 is first and last Sunday)</li>
		<li>X-Z - Short hand for X,Y,Z but otherwise as above.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>

<h2>Weeks since Epoch</h2>
<p>The epoch is the start date of the event.</p>
<p>The WsE value counts the number of weeks since the original start date so that you can repeat on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>There are two forms for WsE:</p>
<ol>
	<li>* - Any week since epoch</li>
	<li>Comma separated - Repeat at the specified weeks in an annual cycle (e.g. 13,26 repeat every 13th and 26th week)</li>
	<li>X/Y - Some week since epoch should be applied:
	<ol>
		<li>The first part (X) represents the weeks of the period to repeat on (e.g. 1,2/3 means the 1st and 2nd weeks in a 3 week cycle)</li>
		<li>The second part (Y) represents the cycle period(s) to repeat over (e.g. 2/4,5 means the 2nd week of both a 4 and a 5 week cycle)</li>
	</ol>
</ol>
<p>The WsE values are the most complex to understand but the intention is to allow X weekly repeating events (e.g. fort-nightly Saturdays: * * 7 1/2).</p>
