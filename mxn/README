WordPress esc_url removes [] from URLs so mxn.js has been patched to
use :gecoder syntax insead of ,[gecoder] syntax. When upgrading the
Mapstraction library remember to re-apply this patch. The new format
is (openlayers,googlev3:geocoder) or just (googlev3:geocoder).

Mapstraction does not provider drag support for markers this has been
added to: googlev3
